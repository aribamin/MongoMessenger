# Group work break-down strategy - Started: 23 March, 2024 || Completion: April 1, 2024
Our group adopted a collaborative approach where we divided the tasks based on individual strengths and interests. Here's a breakdown of the work items among partners:

# Method of Coordination 
We maintained communication primarily through a Discord group chat, where we regularly updated each other on progress, discussed any roadblocks, and coordinated the integration of individual components. Additionally, we held virtual meetings on discord to synchronize our efforts and address any issues collectively. <br />

Initial Tasks:
Ensure all members have joined the GitHub repository for mini project 2, Completition: March 27th, 2024
Create the necessary starting files into the repo - Jared <br />
Update the readme file timelines, remind group members to discuss their contributions in the discord group chat to keep a record of time as well as work done- Dric <br />

Task 1 - Started: 23 March, 2024 || Completition: 29th March, 2024<br />
- Set up the collections and having the documents inserted from the json files (steps 1 and 2) - Jared <br />
- Step 3: Writing the queries needed - Arib <br />
- Step 3.5: Debug queries - Jennifer <br />
- Step 4: Creating indices and reprinting- Arib, Dric <br />
- Final docstrings and outputs - Dric <br /> 

Testing for Task 1 - Dric, Arib, Jared, Jen... Started 23 March, 2024 || Completition: 1 April, 2024<br />

# Code execution guide
- Clone this repository to your local machine. 
- Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (such as pymongo). 
- Ensure the mongodb server is running in the background using mongod --port {any_open_port} --dbpath {folder of choice} & 
- Run the provided Python scripts, with the appropriate command-line arguments as specified in the project guidelines. 
- Ensure you run a build script and wait till it outputs Time taken before executing a query script. For example, run "python3 task1_build.py {port_number}", time taken will output; then run "python3 task2_query.py {same_port_number}" 
- Refer to the report for a comprehensive overview of the system, user guide, and analysis of query runtimes. 

Note
Please ensure that all required files and configurations are set up according to the project specifications to ensure smooth execution of the code. If you encounter any issues, refer to the report or reach out to the group members for assistance. <br />
